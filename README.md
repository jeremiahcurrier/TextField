# App name

This app takes two custom fields, a checkbox & a text field, and when the checkbox is checked the text field is populated with either nothing, the group assigned to the ticket, or the agent assigned to the ticket if present.

Toggling checked vs unchecked will add / remove the text from the text box. 

Updating the ticket is required to save any changes else it will be purely visual.

Please submit bug reports to [Insert Link](https://github.com/jeremiahcurrier/TextField). Pull requests are welcome.
